    "# Creating my Proper Nouns Sets\n",
    "In this notebook, I ran all the processes to extract, sort and filter proper nouns from my text. Many of these processes have been exported to the module noun_sorting, some for reuseability and some largely just to reduce clutter.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "*Note: During this process, I was not always 100% careful about not writing over code when it was things like remove a noun from one list and adding it to another. Therefore, although this notebook will run in its entirety, the results may not be exactly the same as the lists I ended up implementing, as I did not have time to redo all my previous work.*"

    "```sort_basic_ppns``` is probably the biggest single chunk of sorting I was able to do in one go. What this does, is it takes the people and place terms passed into the ```ProperNouns``` object on initialization, and iterates over the strings in its ```ppn_list``` attribute, looking for any strings that contain any of people and place terms. It adds these strings to the correct entry in ```ppn_types``` and collects the strings minus the term used to find it. Next, it passes through the list again looking for any strings that contain the names it found on the first pass.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: on the first pass, the model used the person term ```'Mr.'``` to identify ```'Mr. Bennet'```, ```'Mr. Darcy'```, and ```'Mr. Bingley'``` as people names. Now, the funstion subtracts ```'Mr.'```, and collects the names ```Bennet```, ```Darcy``` and ```Bingley``` to use as search terms for the next pass. Also on the first pass, the function used ```Park``` to identify ```Netherfield Park``` and ```Mansfield Park``` as places. Again, it collects these terms minus the search terms, and adds ```Netherfield``` and ```Mansfield``` to the list of terms of search for on the second iteration. So then on the second pass, it will identify ```Elizabeth Bennet``` and ```Caroline Bingley``` as people, and ```Netherfield House``` and ```Mansfield Hall``` as places.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this second loop, the function also compares each string to the list of months and weekdays passed earlier. Finally, it checks the string against a list of common English place name endings, such as ```shire``` and ```ton```. If the string has satisified not of these comparisons on this second pass, the function adds it to a ```not_classified``` list in order to separate what terms still need sorting."

However, that is because I did a fair amount of item assignment and reassignment that was written over instead of kept, so the current run through is not 100% equivalent to the originally generated types. However, this notebook is a good portrayal of my process - I offloaded as much assignment as I could think of onto functions and loops and searches, assigned the rest of the nouns manually, and doublechecked all noun type lists for accuracy. Although this was lot of manual assignment, in the end it took me only one afternoon to find and categorize with near 100% accuracy, over 800 unique proper nouns, in a corpus with a vocabulary of over 14000 words and a total length of over 700000 words.
