# Pride and Sensibility: Text Generation รก la Jane Austen
### By Edith Johnston

## Objective
### Text generation
I plan to use word embedding and either LSTMs or some variety of attention based neural networks to generate text in the semantic style of Jane Austen.
### Topics
I plan to do said text generation prompted by topic - i.e. I give the model a topic, and it generates a paragraph of text about that topic. In order to define these topics, I plan to try to create some clusters from my documents. Should this fail to produce results, I plan to attempt prompt based text generation.
### Web App
The end goal for this project is to build a web app where a user can select a subject from a drop down menu, and subsequently see a paragraph of generated text about that subject, in the semantic style of Jane Austen.
### Additional Work
Depending on what progress I am able to make, and how long it takes, I would like to expand this project to include other authors with distinct semantic styles.
